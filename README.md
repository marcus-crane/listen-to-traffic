## About

Built by [Stephen LaPorte](https://twitter.com/sklaporte) and [Mahmoud Hashemi](https://twitter.com/mhashemi).

Listen to Wikipedia is inspired by Maximillian Laumeister's [BitListen](http://www.bitlisten.com/).

We fixed up some of the sounds using
[Sound eXchange](http://sox.sourceforge.net/Docs/Documentation), which
is some cool software.
